# Convex Hull Algorithm with Graphical Visualization

## Description
The Convex Hull Algorithm with Graphical Visualization project is a Python-based software application developed in Jupyter Notebook. It implements the convex hull algorithm and provides a graphical interface to visualize the process. The convex hull algorithm is used to find the smallest convex polygon that contains all given points in a two-dimensional space. This project aims to help users understand the convex hull algorithm better by providing a visual representation of how it works.

## Installation
To use the Convex Hull Algorithm with Graphical Visualization project in Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/convex-hull-visualization.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd convex-hull-visualization`
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file: `convex_hull_visualization.ipynb`

## Usage
Once you have opened the Jupyter Notebook file, you can run the cells to execute the code and interact with the graphical interface. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to input points and visualize the convex hull algorithm in action.

## Features
- Graphical visualization of the convex hull algorithm within Jupyter Notebook.
- Ability to input custom points or generate random points.
- Interactive interface for adding, removing, and modifying points.
- Real-time display of the convex hull construction process.

## Code Overview
The code provided in the Jupyter Notebook implements the convex hull algorithm and the graphical visualization interface. Here's a brief overview of the main components:
  - This is the main Jupyter Notebook file containing the code for the convex hull algorithm and the graphical interface. It consists of multiple cells that can be executed sequentially
    to run the application.
  - This file contains the implementation of the convex hull algorithm. It provides functions to compute the convex hull of a set of points.
  - This file handles the graphical visualization of the convex hull algorithm. It uses libraries such as Matplotlib to draw points, lines, and polygons on the screen.
